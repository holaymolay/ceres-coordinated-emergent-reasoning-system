Status: Export snapshot from `memory.md`. If conflict, `memory.md` prevails.
Generated by `scripts/export-handover.py` from `memory.md` on 2026-01-06T17:56:54.297433Z.

## Current Focus
- Maintain CERES governance artifacts and hub documentation during reorganization.

## Recent Progress
- Added canonical docs for layer model and repo assignment.
- Added measurement/ratification todo for recursive execution (step 6 prompt executed).
- Added execution adapter todo (step 5 prompt executed).
- Added arbitration escalation rules todo (step 4 prompt executed).
- Added non-authoritative execution-pressure signaling todo (step 3 prompt executed).
- Added recursive execution governance hardening todo (step 2 prompt executed).
- Added recursive execution governance declaration todo (step 1 prompt executed).
- Allocated spec_id 0271daf2-e9e9-47ef-884c-c3c08ddf888e and recorded spec_allocated event.
- Updated README messaging and added DOCS.md index via prompt artifact execution.
- Added preflight gate script and auto-push safeguards.
- Installed handover auto-sync hooks and session watcher.
- Confirmed governance-orchestrator/.gitignore already ignores logs/.
- Added ClarificationRequest governance rule, enforcement, and anti-pattern to the Constitution.
- Documented skills registry gap and recommended a projection (docs/skills-registry-gap.md).
- Added mobile domain boundary documentation, concepts, and synchronizations for mobile support.
- Added modes_settings_profiles.schema.yaml (interaction modes, settings, profiles schema).
- Added modes/settings/profiles validation rules (docs/modes-settings-profiles-validation.md).
- Added modes/settings/profiles governance rules to the Constitution.
- Added modes/settings/profiles interaction flow specification (docs/modes-settings-profiles-ux.md).
- Added runtime resolver for modes/settings/profiles with precedence and auto-safe enforcement (scripts/resolve-mode-settings.py).
- Documented recursive, environment-mediated execution mode (latent, disabled by default).

## Next Steps
- Complete Spec Elicitation Record, then populate Objective Contract and Gap Ledger when starting a new project.
- Use `scripts/preflight.sh --mode execute` before execution.

## Risks / Blockers
- None recorded.
