## Current Focus
- [ ]


## Next Features & Updates
- [ ] Measure recursive execution impact and decide promote/retain/remove (baseline vs escalated, failures, costs, wins, regressions).
- [ ] Implement execution adapter after arbitration approval (artifact-only recursion, budgeted termination, locked finalization; no change without approval).
- [ ] Define arbitration-only escalation rules (approval/denial conditions, hard ceilings, required observability).
- [ ] Define non-authoritative execution-pressure signals (no authority, no intent, explicit emit/do-not-emit rules).
- [ ] Harden recursive execution governance language (MUST/MUST NOT, close loopholes, verify backward compatibility; block on ambiguity).
- [ ] Define recursive, environment-mediated execution mode (non-user-visible; disabled by default; no LLM escalation; default unchanged).
- [ ] Execute `dev_notes/prompt_12_introduce_mobile_development_support.md`.

## Backlog
- [ ] Minimize CERES footprint in new projects (smallest visible files/folders without losing required artifacts).
