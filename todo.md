## Next Features & Updates


- [ ] Define arbitration-only escalation rules (approval/denial conditions, hard ceilings, required observability). (depends on: governance hardening + signals)
- [ ] Implement execution adapter after arbitration approval (artifact-only recursion, budgeted termination, locked finalization; no change without approval). (depends on: arbitration rules)
- [ ] Measure recursive execution impact and decide promote/retain/remove (baseline vs escalated, failures, costs, wins, regressions). (depends on: execution adapter)

## Backlog
- [ ] Minimize CERES footprint in new projects (smallest visible files/folders without losing required artifacts).
