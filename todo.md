## Bugs
- [ ] 

## Workflow Governance
- [ ] 

## Current Focus
- [ ] Add `logs/` to `governance-orchestrator/.gitignore`.


## Next Features & Updates
- [ ] Define non-authoritative execution-pressure signals (no authority, no intent, explicit emit/do-not-emit rules).
- [ ] Harden recursive execution governance language (MUST/MUST NOT, close loopholes, verify backward compatibility; block on ambiguity).
- [ ] Define recursive, environment-mediated execution mode (non-user-visible; disabled by default; no LLM escalation; default unchanged).
- [ ] Execute prompt: prompts/prompt-recursive-exec-step-4-arbitration-rules.md
      Outcome: Add todo for arbitration escalation rules.
- [ ] Execute prompt: prompts/prompt-recursive-exec-step-5-execution-adapter.md
      Outcome: Add todo for execution adapter (post-approval).
- [ ] Execute prompt: prompts/prompt-recursive-exec-step-6-measurement-ratification.md
      Outcome: Add todo for measurement and ratification.
- [ ] Execute prompt: prompts/prompt-clarification-request-governance.md
      Outcome: Add governance rule + ClarificationRequest artifact and anti-pattern.
- [ ] Execute prompt: prompts/prompt-skills-registry-gap.md
      Outcome: Decide on skills registry projection and document current skills status.
- [ ] Execute `dev_notes/prompt_12_introduce_mobile_development_support.md`.

## Backlog
- [ ] Minimize CERES footprint in new projects (smallest visible files/folders without losing required artifacts).
