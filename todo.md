# Todo (CERES template)

## Bugs
- [ ]

## Workflow Governance
- [x] Enforce SEA integration: document invocation in PROMPTLOADER/README and ensure governance references SEA phase ordering.

## Current Focus
- [ ] Implement inference enforcement: Gap Ledger stage with interrogator/resolver policies in governance runtime.
- [ ] Wire observability hooks across components using `scripts/log_event.py` (stage transitions, gate outcomes).
- [x] Produce canonical layer/repo diagram and fill dev_notes/0 A canonical_layer_model.md.
- [ ] Align spec-compiler/readme-spec-engine to consume hub schemas (Objective Contract, Gap Ledger, Task Plan, Prompt Debug Report).

## Next Features & Updates
- [ ] Add strict todo template hash/header validation to lifecycle gate.
- [ ] Extract observability into dedicated repo once hooks are in place.

## Backlog
- [ ] Add advisory Concept/Synchronization signal capture post-elicitation (non-binding) helper script.
