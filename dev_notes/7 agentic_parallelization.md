Absolutely, that's exactly what I'm here for! Let me wrap it all up into a master prompt for you:

**Codex Prompt: Implement a Parallel Agent Orchestration Layer**

Please create a new repository dedicated to a parallel agent orchestration layer that leverages the Codex CLI. This layer should be able to run multiple Codex instances in parallel.

**Requirements:**

1. Set up a new GitHub repository for this parallelization layer and include a README with usage instructions.
2. Develop a script (in Python or shell) that detects it's running Codex and can execute multiple `codex exec` commands in parallel.
3. Allow configuration of how many parallel instances to run.
4. Include basic error handling and logging so the user can monitor execution.
5. Make the layer modular so it can be adapted for other LLMs like Gemini in the future.

**Output:**

* A repository containing the parallelization script.
* A README file explaining how to use and configure the layer.

That should cover everything!
