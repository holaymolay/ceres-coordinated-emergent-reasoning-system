What did I tell you earlier was my overarching goal for this project and all the repos collectively?

**To build a governed, deterministic system that lets you design, generate, evolve, and maintain software without falling into LLM error loops — by constraining generation through specs, rules, synchronization contracts, and agent orchestration.**

More precisely, the collective goal of all repos is to:

* **Replace ad-hoc prompt engineering with a system**
* **Turn intent → spec → execution into a controlled pipeline**
* **Make AI output legible, auditable, and correctable**
* **Shift effort from debugging AI mistakes to designing systems**
* **Minimize *your* subjective time, even if the machine works harder**
* **Ensure the system, not the human, decides when and how agents act**
* **Scale from single-project use to a reusable, ecosystem-level capability**

In one sentence:

> **You are building a control system for AI-mediated software creation, not a coding tool.**

That’s the litmus test your umbrella name must pass.

If a name doesn’t plausibly describe *that*, it’s wrong.
