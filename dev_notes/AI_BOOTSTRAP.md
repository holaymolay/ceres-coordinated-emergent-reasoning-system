Below is a **clean, temporary bootstrap artifact** plus a **naming strategy** that is consistent with your actual goal: a governed control system for AI-mediated creation.

No fluff. No branding poetry. This is mechanical and correct.

---

## Part 1 — `AI_BOOTSTRAP.md` (temporary, umbrella repo)

This file is **not governance**, **not a prompt**, and **not permanent**.
It exists to let *any* agent enter the ecosystem safely before the final name and constitution are locked.

You can drop this in the root of the umbrella repo **today**.

---

### `AI_BOOTSTRAP.md`

```md
# AI_BOOTSTRAP.md
Status: TEMPORARY · NON-BINDING · BOOTSTRAP ONLY

This repository is the umbrella entry point for a governed AI execution ecosystem.

This file exists solely to:
- declare intent
- orient agentic systems
- prevent free-form or ad-hoc generation
- bridge until the final Constitution is ratified

It is NOT a prompt.
It is NOT a spec.
It is NOT a replacement for governance.

---

## 1. System Intent (Non-Negotiable)

This ecosystem exists to build a **governed, deterministic control system** for AI-mediated software creation.

The system:
- replaces ad-hoc prompt engineering
- converts human intent → specs → execution through controlled stages
- makes AI output legible, auditable, and correctable
- minimizes human subjective time
- ensures the system, not the human, decides when and how agents act
- scales from single-project usage to a reusable ecosystem

In one sentence:

> This is a control system for AI-mediated creation, not a coding tool.

Any agent that cannot operate under these constraints must not act.

---

## 2. Operating Model (Summary)

All work in this ecosystem follows this lifecycle:

1. Constitution (binding)
2. Objective Contract (draft → committed)
3. Inference Phase
   - readiness assessment
   - gap ledger creation
   - resolution strategy selection
4. Planning (allowed under partial certainty)
5. Controlled Prototyping (explicit, bounded, tagged)
6. Lock-In Moment (commit)
7. Deterministic Execution (PDCA enforced)

Uncertainty must be explicit.
Exploration must be bounded.
Execution without commitment is forbidden.

---

## 3. Canonical Governance Sources

This umbrella repo delegates authority to the following repositories.

They are not libraries.
They are **authoritative subsystems**.

### Governance & Orchestration
- https://github.com/holaymolay/cef-governance-orchestrator

### Specification & Intent Compilation
- https://github.com/holaymolay/cef-spec-compiler
- https://github.com/holaymolay/cef-readme-spec-engine

### UI Legibility & Constraints
- https://github.com/holaymolay/cef-ui-constitution
- https://github.com/holaymolay/cef-ui-pattern-registry

No agent may invent rules that conflict with these repos.

---

## 4. Agent Behavior While Bootstrapping

Until a formal Constitution replaces this file:

- Agents may infer intent, but must record assumptions explicitly
- Agents must produce Gap Ledgers before planning
- Agents must ask **one question per turn** when clarification is required
- No irreversible architectural decisions are allowed
- No cross-repo changes without explicit coordination

This file expires when the formal Constitution is adopted.

---

## 5. Replacement Clause

This file is intentionally disposable.

When a ratified Constitution exists:
- This file must be deleted
- All agents must re-anchor to the Constitution
- No backward compatibility is implied

If this file still exists, the system is still in bootstrap mode.
```

---

## Part 2 — Naming: stop using `context-engineering-framework`

You’re correct to abandon it.

**Why it fails the litmus test:**

* sounds like a technique, not a control system
* implies prompting, not governance
* does not describe epistemic enforcement
* undersells determinism and orchestration

---

## Part 3 — Correct naming pattern (mechanical, not cute)

Your ecosystem has **three layers** that must be reflected in names:

1. **Umbrella system** → what *decides*
2. **Governance core** → what *enforces*
3. **Subsystems** → what *executes*

Right now, names are inverted.

---

## Part 4 — Recommended renaming (conservative, minimal churn)

### Umbrella repo (NEW NAME REQUIRED)

This must describe the *entire system*, not one technique.

**Strong candidates (ranked):**

1. **`governed-execution-system`**
2. **`deterministic-execution-ecosystem`**
3. **`contractual-ai-control-system`**
4. **`spec-governed-execution`**
5. **`constitutional-execution-system`**

If it doesn’t plausibly describe **air traffic control for AI**, it’s wrong.

---

### Core governance repo (currently `cef-governance-orchestrator`)

Rename to something that reflects authority, not plumbing.

Suggested:

* `execution-governor`
* `governance-core`
* `constitutional-orchestrator`

---

### Subsystems (tighten, don’t rename unless needed)

These are mostly fine, but consistency matters:

| Current                 | Suggested               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| cef-spec-compiler       | spec-compiler           |
| cef-readme-spec-engine  | intent-ingestion-engine |
| cef-ui-constitution     | ui-constitution         |
| cef-ui-pattern-registry | ui-pattern-registry     |

Drop `cef-` once the umbrella name carries the identity.

---

## Part 5 — The invariant you must protect

Everything you’ve designed collapses if this becomes “a framework” again.

This system exists to answer:

* what is known
* what is unknown
* when inference is allowed
* when guessing is forbidden
* when commitment occurs
* who is allowed to act

That is a **control problem**, not a dev-tool problem.

Your naming, structure, and bootstrap file must all enforce that reality.

---

If you want, next step options (pick one):

1. Lock the umbrella name
2. Finalize the Constitution file
3. Produce a migration plan (repo renames + README updates)
4. Write the *formal* Constitution that replaces `AI_BOOTSTRAP.md`

One step at a time.
