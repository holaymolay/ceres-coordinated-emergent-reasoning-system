# Prompt Artifacts

This directory holds:
- Canonical system prompts: `plan.md`, `execute.md`
- Long-form prompt artifacts: `prompt-<slug>.md`
- Completed prompt artifacts are archived in `prompts/completed/`.

Long-form prompts are governed artifacts. They must follow the required structure and be referenced from `todo.md` rather than embedded inline. After execution, move them to `prompts/completed/`.

See `docs/prompt-artifacts.md` and `templates/prompt-artifact.md` for the rules and template.
