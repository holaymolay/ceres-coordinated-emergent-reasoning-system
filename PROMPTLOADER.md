# PROMPTLOADER.md
Status: Entry file · Canonical umbrella name locked

Umbrella name: **CERES — Coordinated Emergent Reasoning System** (final; no aliases above it).

## Read This First
- The binding source of truth is `CONSTITUTION.md`. Load and obey it before any action.
- This file exists to point agents to the Constitution and anchor the CERES name.

## Quick Rules (see Constitution for full detail)
- Governed lifecycle only: Objective Contract → Inference (Gap Ledger) → Planning (Task Plan → `todo.md`) → Controlled Prototyping → Lock-In → Execution (PDCA) → Verification.
- Attention-bounded interaction: one bounded question per turn with rationale and visible state.
- No execution before a visible Task Plan exists in `todo.md`.
- All intake goes through the Prompt Debugger before governance; no silent fixes.
- No cross-repo changes without explicit coordination; execution obeys, governance decides.

If `CONSTITUTION.md` exists, it prevails over this file.
